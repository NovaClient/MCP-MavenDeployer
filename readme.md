# Nova Maven Deployer
## Allows you to deploy minecraft's libraries into maven fast & safe
### Usage:
0. You ***can't*** use it **Directly** (Means you can still use it, but you need to change something). All dependencies have been deployed to our Nova Maven Repository (It's private tho lol) , you can use them now by connecting to our VPN (VPN, virtual private network. So it's private :D). The only way you can use it is by modifying the code. Since it's WTFPL. You can make money with it, but I don't know how can you make money with this stupid script lol.

### Really? What if I really want to use this script? (Since MavenMCP repositories are broken)
You can just change a single value, but I don't know what did I code.<br>
Since the code is pretty short and lightweight, you can just read the code.<br>
You can probably just change "/home/fan87/.minecraft/libraries" to your .minecraft/libraries, and also change your repository name by changing deploy file command.<br>
You'll want to learn Maven Deploy Plugin first, by adding a private repository, you can go ~/.m2 and modify a file called settings.xml. For more information, please check maven document.<br>

### License
[***Do what the fuck you want to public license (WTFPL)***](http://www.wtfpl.net/) since I made this in like 2 minutes or something<br>
I don't care if it's skidded, cuz anyone can make this in 2 minutes I guess.<br>
Oh, btw, the time im writing readme.md is even longer than coding. Blyat.


### About the script
"Yes, do what I said." is from apt remove or something like that.<br>
Never do `apt remove python3`<br>
It will kill your computer in 10 seconds.<br>
It's not worth it unless you got virtual machine<br>
I was dumb and thought you know what let's remove python3<br>
and boom my computer is gone<br>
the only way you can save this computer is by re-installing entire system<br>
